# UFOs

# Overview
Add to the dynamic webpage for a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. To do this we will need to add filters for multiple criteria at the same time. The new criteria to include are: city, state, country and the shape of the sighted UFO.

# Results
Once they enter the website the user will be able to see the Title at the center with a comment from Ufologists. Underneath these paragraphs the user will find a table listing UFO sightings as well as a Filter Search section where they can filter for more specific sightings by Date, City, State, Country and Shape of UFO.

To filter the table the user can select any one, several or all of the filters available so that the table only shows the desired list of sightings.

# Summary
We have created a webpage that includes all information desired as well as a dynamic table that can be modified with several different filters. We can filter the table with one, several or all the filters available and only see the desired data. 
One other recommendation I would make would be to let the user know the options that they have to search from. What states are included in the dataset, the start and end date, format of the states. In this case we could even remove the Country filter since all the sightings included here are in the US. Also, a dropdown could be added for the states and/or shapes available so that the user is not confused or misses important information due to not knowing what are the shapes available.
